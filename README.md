# Endless-FPS

## Problem statement
### Introduction
  While fps games are still very much loved and titles of the genre can be found amongst the most played games in all platforms, it seems that developers have stepped away from creating endless fps games in the last few years. Regardless if we’re talking about gaming veterans nostalgic for titles such as Unreal Tournament or people who just want to wind off after a day of work, we believe that a strong endless FPS title up-to-date with modern, state of the art technologies, would have massive success amongst gamers. The purpose of EndKill is to fill the gap that we have identified.
### Success Criteria
   In order for EndKill to be successful on the market, we’ve identified the following objectives:
- The game should be really hard. Judging by the success of recent endless titles, people love to hate difficult, punishing endless video games. They love to have a hard time playing it and they love to share it. The game difficulty should be engineered for virality.
- Mechanics should be very easy to learn, but hard to master. It’s important to not have many barriers before first starting a game. Ideally, you should have anyone who played a FPS game before know within 10 seconds how to play the game. This should be perfectly balanced with the difficulty of the game.
EndKill should feel almost winnable. Every time you lose a game should give you the feeling that you could have done better. After they fail, players should get a sinking feeling of failure that they just want to beat.
- A scoring system should be in place. In the midst of being disappointed that they lost, ideally, gamers are going to brag about their score to their friends and on their internet. But, on the internet, there is always somebody with a better score than you, motivating you to give it another go. 
### Design
  EndKill will throw the user straight into fast-paced action, prompting him to survive for as long as possible. An arcade-style point system will be introduced to enable gamers to track their performance in different sessions. 
  After some amount of time in a session, random time-limited events will start, which will offer a considerable amount of points. Powerups and more powerful weapons will be scattered across the map: they will aid the player to battle the enemies which will spawn increasingly faster as time goes by.
  Players will be able to increase the difficulty of the game, making the enemies faster, more accurate and more aware of their environment. In this way, their initial difficulty would match the difficulty that the other players would still reach at later stages of the game.

## Non-functional requirements list

- The game should be stable on any PC system so that gameplay remains enjoyable
- The game should be intuitive and attractive to an audience in the 16-30 age group
- Best possible performance, without requiring better than average device specifications
- Unique game scenarios for the players, otherwise repeatability may decrease the player base
- The game should allow the players to change the difficulty depending on their skills

## Definition of done & definition of ready

### Definition of Done:
 - Game passess the agreed upon business acceptance criteria
 - Code passes manual testing
 - Code is cleaned up and reviewed by the team
 - Code is present in staging environment
 - Code is commited to main git hub branch
 - Code meets the criteria in the user story
 - All user stories in sprint meet the definition of done

### Definition of Ready:
 - The team needs to have talked about the story
 - Story must add something to the project
 - Story time to complete must be estimated
 - Story needs coherent acceptance criteria
 - The sprint has to contain only valid user stories
 - The sprint does not have an excessive amount of user stories
